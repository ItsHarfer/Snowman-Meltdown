snowman.py

Main entry point for the Snowman Meltdown game.

This module initializes and manages the full game loop. It selects a random word,
displays the snowman ASCII art based on the number of incorrect guesses, and processes
user input until the word is guessed or the snowman melts. The game includes input
validation, a replay option, and extended ASCII art stages for smoother transitions.

Functions:
- get_random_word: Selects a random word from the word list.
- get_valid_input: Ensures input is a valid, new single alphabetical character.
- display_game_state: Displays current snowman stage, word progress, and guessed letters.
- play_game: Manages the interactive gameplay loop with win/loss conditions.
- main: Entry point to start the game with replay functionality.
